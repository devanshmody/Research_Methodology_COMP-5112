# Emotion Recognition From Speech

The understanding of emotions from voice in a human brain are normal instincts of human beings, but automating the process of emotion recognition from speech without referring any language or linguistic information remains an uphill grind. In this research work based on the input speech, I am trying to predict one of the six types of emotions (sad, neutral, happy, fear, angry, disgust).
