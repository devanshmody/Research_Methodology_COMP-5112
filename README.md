# Emotion Recognition From Speech

The understanding of emotions from voice in a human brain are normal instincts of human beings, but automating the process of emotion recognition from speech without referring any language or linguistic information remains an uphill grind. In this research work based on the input speech, I am trying to predict one of the six types of emotions (sad, neutral, happy, fear, angry, disgust). The diagram given below explain how emotion recognition from speech works. First audio features are extracted from input speech then those features are passed to the emotion recognition model which predicts one of the six emotion for the given input speech.

# Motivation 

Most of the smart devices or voice assistants or robots exsisting in the world are not smart enough to understand the emotions. They are just like command and follow devices they have no emotional intelligence. When people talking to each other based on the voice they understand situation and react to it, for instance if someone is angry then other person will try to clam him by conveying in soft tone, these kind of harmonic changes are not possible with smart devices or voice assistants as they lack emtional intelligence. So adding emotions and making devices understand emotions will take them one step further to human like intelligence.

# Application

There are tonnes of applicates based on one can imagine. Few applications based on my thinking are human computer interaction using voice, Hhome automation,  anger/stress management by decoding emotions from voice, emotion recognition can help in detecting fear and cops can used this system to check if dialer is feared by some one or its just a normal call to register a complain, Marketing companies can use emotions to sell products based on user mood, autonomus vehicles can detect user emotion and adjust the speed of vehicles, It can help in solving psychological or depression problems. These are few applications according to me but there can be many more as voice based systems are increasing, even voice bsed chatting is common on social media platforms like clubhouse, discord, twitch, and others.
